## Stimulus Aid Interactive Data Visualization

#### By: Livia Mucciolo

### Description

In March 2021, President Biden proposed and signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP), one of the largest COVID-19 relief acts. The ARP legislation substantially raised the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000 per child and made it fully refundable for 2021 (prior, it was only refundable up to $1,400 per child). The ARP also provided families $1,400 in stimulus payments for any individual or dependent. 
Alongside the goal of pandemic relief to the economy and households, the ARP was expected to cut child poverty in half in 2021. 

When the ARP was proposed, I was working in Washington DC at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center as a research assistant. My job included analyzing tax bills and their respective effects on the American population. Right after President Biden announced the bill, TPC received a request from a journalist at the New York Times asking for a distributional analysis of the major tax provisions in the bill by household size, type, and income. Using our in-house tax microsimulation model we produced the requested numbers, which were published in an [UpShot article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/upshot/stimulus-bill-money-families.html). 

For this project, I aim to reimagine the visualizations in the NYT article, as well as add an interactive component. While the ARP was signed years ago, and the effects of the pandemic have diminished, I hope to use this exercise as a way to rethink how to display tax data in a way that viewers can actively engage with. 

### Data Sources
The data I produced in 2021 for the NYT was graciously provided to me by my previous employer. It is two excel spreadsheets with different tabs/tables for the different types of households and number of children. They have requested I do not publish the raw data as it goes into more detail than the typical estimates they publicly release [(see example here)](https://taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/american-rescue-plan-act-2021-final-version-passed-senate-and-house-march-2021/t21-0).

### Guiding Examples
2-3 examples of the kinds of interactive visualization you are considering. Refer to the notes from Week 4 for examples, and/or look for unique interactives that you can imagine telling a story about your chosen data. For each of your examples include: a URL short description of how you're currently thinking about approaching your data with ideas from the visualization you've linked make it clear if you think that your approach fits best with Options A/B/C from above.

1. What is the best way to go about keeping the data private?
