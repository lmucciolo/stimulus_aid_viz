# Stimulus Aid Interactive Data Visualization

Livia Mucciolo

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal has not changed since the proposal. It remains to provide an 
interactive interface where users can see the average amount of aid they can expect from
the March 2021 stimulus bill, as well as an interactive figure to compare themselves 
with other types of households.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

I am still working with a former colleague to determine if the CSV I compiled
(using the data they provided to me) can be publicly released in my repository.
I should hopefully have an answer this week. 

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.

To see your results you must first choose a value from each of the three dropdown 
menus. Once your selections have been made click on the update results button 
to see your results on the right hand box. The updated results will also
be highlighted in the figure below. You can toggle between the two measures to
compare yourself to other types of households.


## Include a _numbered_ list of questions for us to respond to.

1. What would be a good way to deal with errors when choosing ‘select one’ 
instead of other values? What should I display in the results? Should I keep 
as is with NaN? For context, I could not find much on bulma's website for how 
to make selections required.
